# Core elements

All electrical components are created by these core components. Think of them as small building blocks that together create a component. There are the most low-level components that this library offers.

If you feel that the default "electrical logic" that comes by default with the other components doesn't suit your application, you can use this components to create your own version of the `ElectricalCore` component or others. And, therefore, your own custom logic.
