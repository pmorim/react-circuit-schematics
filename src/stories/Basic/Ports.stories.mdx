# Ports

Ports are what allow you to create connections (`<Connection />`) between components.

They can be of 3 different types: `hybrid`, `input`, and `output`. `input` ports can only connect to `output` ports and vice versa; whereas `hybrid` ports don't have those restrictions, i.e., they can connect with all other types.

## Simple Port

This is how a port looks like by default:

<Story name='Simple Port'>
  <Ports style={{ position: 'absolute' }}>
    <Port />
  </Ports>
</Story>

<Padding />

## Organization

You can organize the `<Port />` components inside the `<Ports />` component. This component is just a simple `<div />` and is entirely optional; its only use is organization.

<Canvas>
  <Story name='Organization'>
    <Ports>
      <Port bounds={{ x: 25, y: 25 }} />
      <Port bounds={{ x: 50, y: 25 }} />
    </Ports>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
