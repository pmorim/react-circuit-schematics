# Circuit Canvas

The `<CircuitCanvas />` is where you place all of the electrical components (as children).

## Empty Canvas

This is a empty `<CircuitCanvas />`. You can customize its size and grid.

<Canvas>
  <Story name='Empty Canvas'>
    <CircuitCanvas />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Filled Canvas

You can, then, easily populate the canvas with electrical components.

<Canvas>
  <Story name='Filled Canvas'>
    <CircuitCanvas>
      <h2>R1</h2>
      <h2>R2</h2>
    </CircuitCanvas>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
